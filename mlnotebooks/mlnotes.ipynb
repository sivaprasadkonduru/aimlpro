    "Cost function measures the performance of a machine learning model for given data. Cost function quantifies the error between predicted and expected values and present that error in the form of a single real number. Depending on the problem, cost function can be formed in many different ways. The purpose of cost function is to be either:\n",

    "Minimized: The returned value is usually called cost, loss or error. The goal is to find the values of model parameters for which cost function return as small a number as possible.\n",
    "Maximized: In this case, the value it yields is named a reward. The goal is to find values of model parameters for which the returned number is as large as possible."
